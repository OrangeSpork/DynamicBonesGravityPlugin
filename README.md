# DynamicBonesGravityPlugin

I got tired of most of the dynamic bones things being excessively floaty. This fixes that in a non-destructive manner. Doesn't conflict with existing force settings and will not override anything else touching gravity settings, just changes default gravity from 0,0,0 to 0,x,0 depending on config chosen in plugin settings. Defaults off.
